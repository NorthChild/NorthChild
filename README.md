A LITTLE ABOUT ME:
Full-Stack engineer
Data science student

Python, PHP, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, CSS.

I'm a massive STEM nerd, i love learning and challenging myself,
inexorably stretching the boundaries of what i'm capable of accomplishing.

Highly sociable introvert who loves people as much as its own private time.

After a long journey of self discovery, i decided to dedicate my life to the stem field, soon after discovering programming, i realised that i could work in any stem discipline with it, that's why i changed field originally, dropping everything to learn and be proficient in the amazingly creative medium that is programming.

Transitioning from laboratory science, to computer science and software development.

I was lucky to be able to use the Covid-19 period to make the career switch, get the required qualifications and know-how to become a Full-Stack developer, but its just the start of this exciting journey of mine.
My 'end goal' is to get into Data, Computational Science.
